Now unto BibLE!!!!!!!!!

I'd like to thank God for helping me get this far into the project. When I first started out, I never thought I would make it. But here we are moving onto stage two! of the project.
There is much more to do

index.html:
remove unnecessarily linked scripts

Scripture.js
passing props are not verified

ParseText issues:

errors to fix include:
auto-save vs full save when it is best
adding more styles
adding an image uploader
adding db rules and auth
*wipes tears* and we will be done :)
John F. Woods (I don't even have a strike through for John. <= lucky you)


DBT issues:
1. When new version is selected, the current book is no longer there although chapter listings are
correct and rendered text is correct
2. When a chapter is selected, the button is not a different color, to show which one was selected
3. Switching bettween chapters has a 2-sec delay

React issues:
-- this has been omitted from entry[] in webpack config
    './app/index.js'
-- make better use of webpack
